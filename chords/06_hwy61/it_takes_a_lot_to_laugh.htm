<h1 class="songtitle">It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry</h1>
<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
	Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Highway 61 Revisited</a> (1965), in different
	studio versions on <a class="recordlink" href="../34_bootleg/index.htm">The Bootleg Series 1-3</a> (1991) and <a class="recordlink" href="../44_bs7_ndh/index.htm">No Direction Home</a> (2005), and in a live version on <a class="recordlink" href="../42_bs5/index.htm">Live 1975</a> (2002)<br />
	Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="songversion">Original album version</h2>
<p>Capo 1st fret (original key Ab major)</p>
<p>The G - C/g - G (320003 - 3x2013 - 320003) pattern goes through the 	whole song. One could play just a sustained G as well. The change of 	this pattern that I've indicated in lines 2 and 4 is mainly to get an approximation to what the second guitar plays there. Likewise, in the last line there seems to be very little activity - maybe there should be just a G all through it.</p>
<p>In later years, the song has been played as a slow, electric blues.</p>

<pre class="verse">
Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby,
  Can't buy a  thrill.
Well, I've been up all night,
Leanin' on the window sill.
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I don't make it,
 You know my baby  will.

Don't the moon look good, mama,
Shinin' through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama,
Flagging down the Double E?
Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine
When she's comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming,
The windows are filled with frost.
I went to tell everybody,
But I could not get across.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be your boss.
Don't say I never warned you
When your train gets lost.

On top of the hill
And if I don't make it,

Ah, don't the sun look good, baby,
Coming down through the trees?
Don't the ghost child look good, mama,
Sittin' on this mad-man's knee?
Don't the moon look good
Goin' down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine
When she's runnin' after me?

Well I just been to the baggage room
where the engineer he's been tossed
Oh, I stamped on 40 compasses,
God knows what they cost
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be your boss.
And I can't help it
if this train gets lost.</pre>

<h2 class="songversion">Bootleg Series version</h2>
<p>Uptempo electric blues with Dylan at the piano (presumably &ndash; it sounds
	like him, and none of the guitars do). The most appropriate way to
	play it on a guitar would be with a capo on the 4th fret (or with
	barr&eacute; chords), as in the following tab.</p>
<p>The accompaniment figure would then be:</p>
<pre class="tab">
  E           E6            E7          E6

|-2-----2-----4-----4-----|-5-----5-----4-----4------|
|-0-----0-----0-----0-----|-0-----0-----0-----0------|
</pre>
<p>The solo guitar plays this little lick at the end of each two-bar
	period (during the E-E6-E7-E6, that is):</p>
<pre class="tab">
     (E6)          (E)

---b8r6---4-------|------------
------------6---4-|-6----------
------------------|------------
</pre>
<p>(b8r6 means that the string is struck in bent position, two semitones,
	as if played on the 8th fret, then released to normal position, on the
	6th fret).<br />
