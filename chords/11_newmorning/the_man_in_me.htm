<h1 class="songtitle">The Man in Me</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
(from the album <a href="index.htm" class="recordlink">New Morning</a>, 1970)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />

<p>This is a piano song, and he prefers to play these on the black keys,
hence the original key is Ab major. On a guitar this suggests a capo
on the 1st fret, with the following chords:</p>

<pre class="verse">
The man in me will do nearly any task,
And as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.

Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it any more.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near,
Sets my a heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen,
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine.
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.

<pre class="verse">
Storms on the river of no return,
I'd try to teach you how, but I know that you never learn.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.</pre>

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
        Bm                         A
Just to know that you're really there,
   Bm                  A
It sets my old heart a-reeling
Bm               C#m        D          E
 right from my feet to the top of the stairs.</pre>
<pre class="verse">
How can you believe it? Well, I guess it's true
I'm lying next to her, baby, but I'm thinking of you
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.

[instrumental verse]

<pre class="bridge">
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you really exist,
It makes my, makes my head go reeling
All you got to do is look my way, and, baby, I just can't resist
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
[I] go down to the border beneath the sun
Calling out her name, but, baby, you're the one
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
