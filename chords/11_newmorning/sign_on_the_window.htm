<h1 class="songtitle">Sign on the Window</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">New Morning</a> (1970)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>Piano song - in F# major, possibly the worst conceivable guitar
key. I suggest a capo on the 2nd fret and the following chords:</p>
<pre class="chords">
Asus2      002200
E/b        x<strong>2</strong>2100
E/a        x<strong>0</strong>2100
E/g#       422100 or 476454
F#m7       242222
F#9        242324
F#m/a      x<strong>0</strong>4222
</pre>

Sign on the window says Lonely,
Sign on the door said No Company Allowed,
Sign on the street says Y' Don't Own Me,
Sign on the porch says Three's A   Crowd,
Sign on the porch says Three's A Crowd.

Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
My best friend said, Now didn' I warn ya,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Brighton girls are like the moon.

Looks like a-nothing but rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street
 Hope that it don't sleet.
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Have a bunch of kids who call me Pa,
That must be what it's all about,
That must be what it's all about.

<p>I accidentally tabbed this one with my guitar tuned down one half tone
-- and that happens to work quite well.</p>
