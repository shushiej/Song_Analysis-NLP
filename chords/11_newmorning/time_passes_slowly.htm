<pre class="verse">

Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
 We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
 Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,
 Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin',
 We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin',
 Starin' out the window     to the stars high above,
Time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love.

 Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
 Ain't no reason to go to the fair.
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
 Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,
  Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,
Time passes slowly and fades away.
