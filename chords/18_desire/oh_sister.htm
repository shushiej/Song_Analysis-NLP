<pre class="verse">
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger.
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?
We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved.

Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
C            Em             F           C
 Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
G              Am              F    C
You should not treat me like a stranger.
C          Em                 F            C

And you must realize the danger.

<h2 class="songversion">Budokan version</h2>

<p>The verses are sung over a sustained G minor chord. The only
difference is the bridge, which is played:</p>

<pre class="bridge">
Bb           C
We grew up together
         Gm
From the cradle to the grave
   Bb              C
We died and were reborn
            Gm
And then mysteriously saved.
