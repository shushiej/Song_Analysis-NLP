<pre class="verse">
Mary wore three links of chain,
Ev'ry link was Jesus name,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

Mary, Mark and Luke and John,
All these prophets so good and gone,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

I never been to heaven, but I've been told,
Streets up there are line with gold,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

Dig my grave with a bloody spade,
See that my digger gets well paid,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

That gospel line gets mighty hot,
But just hang on with all you got,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

When I get to the glory land,
Gonna play in the glory land,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.
