<h1 class="songtitle">Knockin' on Heaven's Door</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a href="index.htm" class="recordlink">Pat Garret &amp; Billy The Kid</a> (1973) and on <a
href="../28_biograph/index.htm" class="recordlink">Biograph</a> (1985), and in live versions on <a
href="../15_beforetheflood/index.htm" class="recordlink">Before the Flood</a> (1974), <a
href="../21_budokan/index.htm" class="recordlink">At Budokan</a> (1978), <em>Dylan and the Dead </em>(1988), <a href="../37_unplugged/index.htm" class="recordlink">MTV Unplugged</a> (1995), and <a
href="../42_bs5/index.htm" class="recordlink">Live 1975</a> (2002)<br />
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />

<p>The challenge with this song is not the chords, which are quite simple, actually, but
the lyrics, which change quite a lot, almost from show to show, with improvised new lines
about what brings him to the door, knockin'.</p>

<p>The Am7 is played as a simple Am in most versions.</p>

<p><a class="recordlink" href="../37_unplugged/index.htm">Unplugged</a> version same as below, but with a capo on the 2nd fret (on Jackson's guitar;
Dylan fumbles around with an occasional lick on an uncapoed guitar).</p>
<p>
In many live versions, the last line of the refrain is &ldquo;Just like so
many times before&rdquo; (thanks to Wayne Hampton for reminding me).

<pre class="verse">
Mama, take this badge off of me
 I can't use it anymore.
 It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
 Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

<h2 class="songversion">Live 1975 version</h2>

<p>The chords are the same as above.</p>

<p>Mama wipe the blood off of my face<br />
I can't see through it anymore<br />
I need someone to talk to, and a new hiding place<br />
I feel like I'm looking at heaven's door</p>

<p>[Roger McGuinn:]<br />
Mama I can hear that thunder roar<br />
Echoin' down from God's distant shore<br />
I can hear 'em callin' for my soul<br />
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door</p>

<h3>Live version, 2001</h3>

<p>The most stable chord sequence in the world (maybe with the exception of &quot;All
Along the Watchtower&quot;) has been changed!</p>

<pre>| E . B . | F#m . . . | E . B . | A . . . |</pre>

<pre class="verse">
E               B            F#m
Mama, take this badge off of me
E        B         A
 I can't use it anymore.
A             E(/g#)            B
 It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
C#m              B                    A
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

<h3>Various live lyric changes</h3>

<p>Mama wipe the blood from my face<br />
I'm sick and tired of the war<br />
Got a lone black feelin', and it's hard to trace<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door<br />

<p>Mama take these bells out of my ears<br />
I can't hear them anymore<br />
They're bringin' me down and givin' me tears<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door</p>

<p>Roger McGuinn's verse:<br />
Mama I can hear that thunder roar<br />
Echoin' down from God's distant shore<br />
I can hear it callin' for my soul<br />

<p>Mama take these tears out of my eyes<br />
I can't see through them anymore<br />
Just for once, I'd like to see the sunrise<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (MSG, &quot;Night of the Hurricane&quot;, 751208)</p>

<p>Mama tow my barge down to sea<br />
Pull it down from shore to shore<br />
Two brown eyes are lookin' at me <br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door. </p>

<p>Goin' down by that road <br />
Feelin' down and more and more <br />
Take the train by [...]<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Earl's Court, London 810328)</p>

<p>[...] on this scene<br />
fallin' down like to the floor<br />
Two brown eyes are looking at me<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Earl's Court, London 810329) </p>

<p>Mama take me above all that misery<br />
Let it fall down to the floor<br />
Two brown eyes are looking at me<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Drammen, Norway, 810710)</p>

<p>Mama take this [front part away]<br />
I just don't want it anymore<br />
Aah, when I get in front of something it's too much to pay<br />
Yeah, Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door</p>

<p>Mama take my boat [out of the sea]<br />
Let it fall down to the floor<br />
Two brown eyes are looking at me<br />
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Avignon, 810725)</p>

<p>Mama wipe the blod from my face<br />
I just can't see trough it any more<br />
Sometimes you feel so damn out of place<br />
And I feel like I'm knockin' on-a heavens door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bristol Connecticut, Lake Compounce 4 Sep, 1988. Submitted by Patrik Winquist)</p>

<p>The sun is setting down<br />
On this ill-forgotten town<br />
Two riders are coming down<br />
Bury my heart in this ground<br />
