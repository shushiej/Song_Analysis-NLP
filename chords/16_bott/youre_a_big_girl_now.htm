<pre class="verse">
 Our conversation  was short and sweet
 It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, oh
And you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow
  You're a big girl now.
Our conversation  was short and sweet
It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, mm -  mm
And you are on dry land, mm -  mm
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now.

Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence,
He's singin' his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh,
Singin' just for you, mm-mm.
I hope that you can hear,
Hear me singin' through these tears.

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days .
Oh, I know where I can find You, oh, oh,
In somebody's room. m-mm
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way.

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear, mm-mm
See what you can do, mm-mm.
I can make it through,
You can make it too.

A change in the weather can be extreme
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind, mm-mm
With a pain that stops and starts, mm-aa
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.

<div class="preamble">
<p>Tabbed from Fort Worth, TX May 16, 1976; the <em>Hard Rain</em>
version from Fort Collins a week later is virtually identical.</p>

<p>Two guitars are prominent: Dylan's and Steven Soles' (according to
Trev Gibb, who got this information from David Mansfield)<br />
1st guitar: Capo 4th fret (sounding key: E major); 2nd guitar no capo</p>

<p>Chords (some of these suggestions incorporate the tones in the bass
and other instruments as well):</p>
<pre class="chords">
Cmaj7    There are many alternatives for this one:
         x35500 gives the b-c clash that is clearly audible, at least in the intro;
         xx5453 is an option, together with G11=3231, if the bass plays the bottom c;
         032000 gives the &quot;Em&quot; feeling, and
         332000 or x32000 is a more straightforward Cmaj7
         xxx987 This is the high ringing guitar in the intro and the first lines of the verses
G11      3x0211. Mute the 5th string with the ring finger - it's not that tricky.
         Can also be played as a Dm or a Dm7 (xx0211, xx0231, xx3231 [with Cmaj7=xx5453])
         xxx765 (goes with xxx987)
</pre>

<p>The second guitar (probably Dylan) plays these chords without a capo
(and correspondingly the other chords a major third higher than noted
in the tab: E, B, A, and F#m):</p>

<pre class="chords">
Emaj7    xx9890 (for Cmaj7)
A6       xx7670 (for G11)
