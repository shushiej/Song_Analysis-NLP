<h1 class="songtitle">Hazel</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Planet Waves</a> (1974)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>The song could equally well be played with C chords and a capo on the
4th fret. Such a version is appended at the end.</p>

<p>The intro is played rather freely (which is a nice way of saying that
they aren't exactly tight...) &ndash; and with both a bass and a guitar. The
tab below is just a suggestion of an approximation.</p>

<pre class="verse">
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.
You got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love.

Hazel, stardust in your eye
You're goin' somewhere and so am I.
I'd give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love.

Oh no, I don't need any reminder
To know how much I really care
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.

Hazel, you called and I came,
Now don't make me play this waiting game.
You've got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
