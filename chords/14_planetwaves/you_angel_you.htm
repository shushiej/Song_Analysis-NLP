<pre class="verse">

You angel you
You got me under your wing.
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing.


You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine.
I just want to watch you talk with your
memory on my mind
You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Yes I never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor.
 If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more (and more).

You angel you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
it's the way it ought to be

You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor.
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more.

You angel you
You got me under your wing.
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it would make me sing.
