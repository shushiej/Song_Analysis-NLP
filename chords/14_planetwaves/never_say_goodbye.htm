<pre class="verse">
Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to brea
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below.
You're beautiful beyond words
You're beautiful to me
You can make me cry
Never say goodbye.


My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground.

The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand.
Oh baby baby baby blue
You've changed you last name, too
You've turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hangin' down.
