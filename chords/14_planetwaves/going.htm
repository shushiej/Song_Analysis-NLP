<pre class="verse">
I've just reached a place
Where the willow don't bend.
There's not much more to be said
It's the top of the end.
I'm going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.

I'm closin' the book
On the pages and the text
And I don't really care
What happens next.
I'm just going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.

I been hangin' on threads,
I been playin' it straight,
Now, I've just got to cut loose
Before it gets late.
So I'm going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.
Grandma said, Boy, go and follow your heart
And you'll be fine at the end of the line.
All that's gold isn't meant to shine.
Don't you and your one true love ever part.

I been walkin' the road,
I been livin' on the edge,
Now, I've just got to go
Before I get to the ledge.
So I'm going,
I'm just going,
I'm gone.

I've just reached a place
Where the willow don't bend.
There's no more to be said
It's the top of the end.
I'm going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.

I've been right on the edge
playing it cool
Now I just got to go
Before I break the rules (?)

I've been leaning on you
for just too long
and it's not (good?) for you
it's not making me strong, so...

I'm in love with you baby
but you got to understand

Come over here baby

You gotta believe it
you gotta give me one more kiss

Fix me one more drink baby

I've just reached a place
where I'm feeling kind of low
I don't mind leaving
And you know I'm not afraid to go

Fix me one more drink baby
and hold me one more time
But don't get too close
and try and make me change my mind

I've been hanging round your house so long
You been treating me like a clown
You don't know how to do nothing,
'cept tear a good man's reputation down
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
You know my mama always said: &quot;Son be true and follow your heart
You'll be fine at the end of the line

<pre class="verse">
Come over here one more time, baby,
you might shake my hand
I could find me another woman
and you could find you another man
