<pre class="verse">
Why must you always try to make me over
Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go.
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go.

You tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you can't overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go.

You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go.
