<h1 class="songtitle">All The Tired Horses</h1>


<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Self Portrait</a> (1970), probably the only Dylan album
which has never been underestimated (enough)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem (there is actually a little finesse here
which justifies the term)</p>

<p>Emsus4 (that's the finesse) is played 022010 (or at least it sounds as
if there is a c there somewhere; it's probably just an overtone
somewhere, and played as a straight Em chord. So much for finesse. . .)</p>
