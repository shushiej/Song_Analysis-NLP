<pre class="verse">

Blue moon you saw me standing alone
 Without a dream in my heart
 Without a love of my own.

Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for.

Then suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, Please adore me
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.

Blue moon now I am no longer alone
Without a dream in may heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own.
