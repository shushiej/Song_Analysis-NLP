<h1 class="songtitle">Minstrel Boy</h1>


<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br />
Performed live on the Isle of Wight festival, and released on
<a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Self Portrait</a> (1970)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>The chords in the chorus are approximations only; the last line could
be played with F - Em - Dm - C as well.<br />
The lyrics are the official ones &ndash; I didn't see any reason to change
them to whatever he sings live.</p>

<pre class="verse">
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Oh, Lucky's drivin' a long, long time
And now he's stuck on top of the hill.
With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb,
And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still.

Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load.
Beneath his bound'ries, what more can I tell,
With all of his trav'lin', but I'm still on that road.

Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
