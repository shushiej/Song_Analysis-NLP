<pre class="verse">
I bless the day I found you
 I want my arms around you
 And so I beg you
    Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from me
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me

 Each time we meet love
 I find complete love
 Without your sweet love
 What would life be ?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always
Let it be me

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
An' say you'll always
Let it be me
</pre>
