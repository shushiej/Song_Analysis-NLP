<pre class="verse">
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You think you know
The smile on her lips
The thrill an' the touch
Of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

You think you'll find
A heaven of bliss
In each caress
In each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away
Memories of what used to be.

You think she's yours
To have and to hold
Someday you'll learn
When her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
