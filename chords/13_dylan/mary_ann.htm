<pre class="verse">
Oh fare thee well my own true love
Fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waitin' an' the wind blows high
An' I am bound away for the sea,
Mary Ann.
    (I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann)

Ten thousand miles away from home
Ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze an' the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you,
Mary Ann.

Oh don't you see that crow fly high
She'll surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear
Mary Ann.

Oh, if I had a flask of gin an' sugar here for two
An' a great big bowl for to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear
Mary Ann
Yes I'd pour a drink for you, my dear
Mary Ann.
