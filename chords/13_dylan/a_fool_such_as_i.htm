<pre class="verse">
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you're gone I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I
Now an' then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love an' now
you say that we are through
I am a fool, but I love you dear, yes I will,
until the day I die
Now an' then there's a fool such as I

Pardon me, pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you're gone, when you're gone, I will dream a little,
I will dream as years go by
Now an' then, now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I.

Now an' then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love an' now
you say that we are through
I am a fool, yes but I love you dear,
I will love you dear, until the day, until the day I die
Now an' then, now an' then there's a fool, a fool such as I
Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I.
Now an' then, there's a fool
such as I.
