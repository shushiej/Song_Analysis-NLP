<pre class="verse">
Wise men say     only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in  love with you.

Shall I stay, will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.

Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you.
