<pre class="verse">
One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright,
Lighting ev'rything in sight,
But tonight no light will shine on me.

Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had,
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rolling sky,
For tonight no light will shine on me.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true,
I had no idea what a woman in love would do!

One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no light will shine on me.

One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss that woman so,
I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no light will shine on me.
