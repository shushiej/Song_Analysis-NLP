Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately   I  see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes she does,
she makes love like a woman, yes she does,
And then she aches just like a woman,
but she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman,
And she makes love like a woman,
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.
It was raining from the first

And I was dying there of thirst
     C            Csus4 C
So I came in here
         E
And your long-time curse hurts

But what's worse
        F
Is this pain in here
        G7
I can't stay in here

Ain't it clear that
I just don't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
And when we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.
You take just like a woman,
And you take just like a woman, yes you do
And you make love like a woman, yes you do
and then you ache just like a woman,
but you break just like a little girl.

<h2 class="songversion">Blonde on Blonde version</h2>

<p>Bob seems to be playing with a capo on the 4th fret, and more or less
the same chords as above.<br />
The 2nd guitar plays without a capo, using the following pattern
(w/variations):</p>

<h2 class="songversion">&ldquo;Before the Flood&rdquo; version</h2>

<p>Played in a very square 4/4 beat. The chords marked &ldquo;/b&rdquo;are probably
G/b, but may even be C/b (or rather: Cadd2/b: x20010). The second and
third Choruses are rushed out of tempo.</p>

<p>* These Am chords are Ds in subsequent verses.</p>
