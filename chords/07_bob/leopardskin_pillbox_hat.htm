  Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  Well, tell me now, baby, how's your head feel, under that,
  Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  
  Well, you wear it so pretty, honey, can I jump on it sometime?
  Well, you wear it so pretty, can I jump on it sometime?
  You know it balances on your head just like a mattress balances
  On a bottle of wine
  Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  
  Well, if you wanna see the sun, honey, I know where
  Mmmm, if you wanna see the sun, we'll just sit there and stare
  Me with my belt wrapped around my head, and you just sittin' there
  In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  
  Well, I asked the doctor could I see you
  but he said it was bad for my health, he said
  Well, I disobeyed his orders
  I came to see you and found him there instead
  Well, I don't mind he's cheating
  But how come he was wearing on his
  Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat?
  
  Well, I see you got a new boyfriend; well, I don't wanna see him no more.
  Well, I saw you makin' love with him, you forgot to close the garage door
  You might think he loves you for your money
  But that ain't true, I know what he really loves you for:
  Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  
  Well I don't drink whiskey, no, I don't drink gin
  But I'm so dirty honey, I've been working all day in the coal bin
  Right now I wanna see you, honey, will you let me in?
  Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
  
  Well, can I be your chaufueur, honey, can I be your chauffeur?
  Well, you can ride with me, honey I'll be your chaufeur
  just as long as you stay in the car -
  if you get out and start to walk, you just might topple over
  in your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
