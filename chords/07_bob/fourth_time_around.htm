<h1 class="songtitle">4th Time Around</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Blonde on Blonde</a> (1966) and in a live version on <a class="recordlink" href="../39_rah/index.htm">Live 1966</a> (1998)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p><hr />

<p>Capo 4th fret (sounding key E major)<br />
And you might as well tune down the E string two steps, to get the dropped C tuning that he uses on Live 1966 (C-A-d-g-b-e').</p>

<p>The versions are quite similar, apart from (1) the little riff running through the album version, and (2) the basic chord alternation, which in the album version is C - F, and on <a class="recordlink" href="../39_rah/index.htm">Live 1966</a> C - Csus4. (it actually sounds like that's what Dylan is playing in the album version as well, but the little riff clearly alternates between C and F, so that's the predominant sound anyway).</p>

<pre class="verse">
When she said,Don't waste
your words, they're just lies,
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face
until breaking my eyes,
Then said, What else you got left?
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, Don't forget,
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.

I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, Don't get cute.
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
And after finding I'd
Forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against . . .

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, No, dear.
I said, Your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum.
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor,
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And, when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then
You didn't waste time.
And I, I never took much,
I never asked for your crutch.
Now don't ask for mine.

<p>As I said, it's identical, just replace all the F's with Csus4's. </p>
