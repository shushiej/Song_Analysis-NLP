<h1 class="songtitle">One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Blonde on Blonde</a> (1966)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p><hr />

<p>Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)<br />
The 2nd guitar is probably playing with a capo on the 1st fret and
chords in E major</p>

<p>*) If you include the note in the piano here, you would get a Dm/f chord</p>

<p>In the refrain there is a nice bass line that one can get by playing the chords:</p>
<pre class="verse">
  I didn't mean to treat you so bad
  You shouldn't take it so personal
  I didn't mean to make you so sad
  You just happened to be there, that's all
  When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile
  I thought that it was well understood
  That you'd be comin' back in a little while
    I didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good
    But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you
I couldn't see what you could show me
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldn't see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didn't realize just what I did hear
I didn't realize how young you were
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you
I couldn't see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew an' I took your word
And then you told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

<p>BTW, this is the same line as in the refrain of Sad-Eyed Lady.</p>
