<p>He didn't seem to spend too much time rehearsing this song before he
went into the studio (the whole album was recorded in one
evening/night session) &ndash; he gets the first verse all wrong in the
chords, and he struggles a lot with the final lines of each
verse. I've written out the chords for the first two verses and in the
following verses deviations from the <em>second</em> verse.</p>

<pre class="verse">
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
We'll meet on edges, soon, said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.
Half-cracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate, I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, thought, somehow
        C             F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    F       G *)      C
I'm younger than that now.

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
Equality, I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
        C             Am
Ah, but I was so much older then
    F       G *)      C
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
   Am                  F      C
My existence led by confusion boats
Am          Em       G *)
Mutiny from stern to bow
        C     Am      F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    G       *)        C
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
        C     Am      F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then
    G       *)        C
I'm younger than that now.
